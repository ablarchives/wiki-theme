### Background

This theme is intended to be used with OctoberCMS and for simple, flat-file informational websites.

The sidebar will automatically list files and folders in the theme's `content` directory. Selecting a file will open it in the primary viewing area. Content files should be in the markdown format and words separated with a hyphen. HTML usage in markdown is supported.

The sidebar logo can be replaced by replacing `logo.png` in the `assets` directory.
